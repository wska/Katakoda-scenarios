This tutorial demonstrates how to secure an API endpoint using Keycloak running in Docker and hosting it on Katacoda. 

The aim of this tutorial is to:

* Provide and explain a simple API using Python and Flask
* Educate about security, Oauth2, OpenID Connect and Keycloak
* Showcase how to set up Keycloak and host it using Docker
* Go through how to set up a realm and add users with different levels of security clearance
* Use the existing Keycloak realm to secure the previously introduced API, which will now require access tokens and the relevant security clearance
