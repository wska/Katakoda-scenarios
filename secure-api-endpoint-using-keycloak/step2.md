# Create a folder to work with

Create a working folder and enter it
```
mkdir project
cd project
```{{execute}}

# Create a python file to work with

```
> api.py
```{{execute}}

# Setting up a very basic program

You can now open the `api.py` file in the *Katakoda* text editor. Navigate to `project/api.py`. And write some code for the Flask app:


<pre class="file" data-filename="project/api.py" data-target="replace">
# Imports
from flask import Flask, g
import json

# Flask settings

# Main
def main():
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

</pre>
